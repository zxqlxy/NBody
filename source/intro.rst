What is Sphinx?
===============

From http://sphinx-doc.org:

* Sphinx is a tool that makes it *easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation*.
* It was *originally created for the new Python documentation*, and it
  has excellent facilities for the documentation of Python projects,
  but C/C++ is already supported as well.

.. warning:: ... a great tool that actually makes programmers **want** to write documentation!

Sphinx Philosophy
-----------------

`Sphinx`_ is a documentation generator. This means it takes plain-text
files in `reStructuredText`_ format and transformes it into HTML, PDF,
and any other output format.

::

    reST -> Sphinx -> HTML (PDF, eBook, ...)

So as a user of Sphinx, your main job will be writing these text files
with `reStructuredText`_ which is similar to Wiki languages like
Markdown.


Sphinx Advantages
-----------------

* Documents are written as **plain text** files.
* **Output formats** will be generated by Sphinx: HTML, PDF, eBook.
* Markup language used (reST) is **similar to Wiki languages** (Markdown, Textile, ...).
* **Layouts** can be replaced, many default layouts available.
* Writer concentrates on content, layout and output comes from Sphinx.
* **Autogenerating** documentation from source code.
* **Syntax highlighting** for many formats (Python, XML, ...).
* **Cross-references** to parts of the documenation (sections, code, glossary, ...) and **automatic indices**.
* **Version control** (GitHub) can be used for collaborative work and keeping track of different document versions.
* The documentation is **part of the source code** repository.
